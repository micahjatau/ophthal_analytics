INTRODUCTION
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, with an estimated 76 million people affected globally and a disproportionately high burden in sub-Saharan Africa. In advanced cases or when medical therapy fails, trabeculectomy remains the gold standard surgical intervention to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) and prevent further optic nerve damage.

In low-resource settings like ours, long-term medication adherence is often poor, and the cost of chronic topical therapy can be prohibitive. Surgical management offers a one-time intervention with the potential to reduce or eliminate dependence on medications. However, real-world data on IOP control, visual acuity (VA) stability, and medication burden post-trabeculectomy remain sparse in our local context.

This study aims to evaluate the clinical outcomes of trabeculectomy in patients managed at our tertiary center by analyzing changes in IOP and VA over time, medication use postoperatively, and the proportion of patients meeting success criteria. By leveraging routinely collected clinical data, we aim to generate insights to guide surgical audit, inform patient counseling, and improve long-term glaucoma care delivery in similar settings.

METHODS
Study Design and Setting

This was a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent trabeculectomy at a tertiary eye care center in Nigeria. Data were extracted from surgical and clinical follow-up records between [INSERT START DATE] and [INSERT END DATE].

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Patients were included if they had:

A documented trabeculectomy (with or without combined cataract surgery),

Available intraocular pressure (IOP) and visual acuity (VA) data at baseline and at least one follow-up visit (1 day, 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years post-op).

Patients were excluded if key preoperative or postoperative data were missing or if the procedure performed was not a trabeculectomy.

Data Collection and Cleaning

Variables extracted included:

Demographics: age, sex, laterality (eye operated).

Clinical data: VA and IOP at baseline and follow-up timepoints (1 day, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years).

Medication usage: number or presence of glaucoma medications preoperatively and at follow-up.

Surgery type: categorized as Trabeculectomy alone or Combined (trabeculectomy + cataract extraction).

Data were cleaned and structured using R. VA entries were converted to logMAR using a custom mapping function that handled both standard Snellen fractions (e.g., "6.60" → 6/60) and qualitative entries (e.g., "PL", "HM", "CF"). IOP entries were cleaned and converted to numeric, and medication usage was harmonized into binary (on/off) and count formats.

Outcomes

Primary outcomes included:

Change in IOP from baseline across all follow-up points.

Change in VA (logMAR) from baseline.

Surgical success, defined using standard criteria:

Complete success: ≥30% IOP reduction from baseline without medications.

Qualified success: ≥30% IOP reduction from baseline with medications.

Failure: <30% IOP reduction or return to medication use.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics (mean, median, proportions) were used to summarize patient characteristics and outcomes. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests assessed differences in IOP and VA between baseline and follow-up.

A linear mixed-effects model (LMM) was used to evaluate the trajectory of IOP over time, with patient ID as a random intercept. Covariates including age and surgery type were explored in interaction terms.

Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to estimate time to surgical failure, defined as either medication restart or failure to meet IOP reduction criteria.

All analyses were performed using R (version X.X.X), with significance set at p < 0.05.

DISCUSSION
1. Principal Findings

In this retrospective cohort of glaucoma patients undergoing trabeculectomy at a tertiary center, we observed a statistically significant reduction in IOP from preoperative levels at all measured postoperative timepoints up to two years. The mean IOP decreased from 24.5 mmHg preoperatively to 13.8 mmHg at 6 months (p = 0.003), with sustained reduction observed at 1 year (mean: 16.3 mmHg). Notably, over 60% of patients were medication-free at last follow-up, reflecting a meaningful reduction in treatment burden.

Visual acuity (VA) remained stable or improved in 70% of patients at 6 months, although this change was not statistically significant (p = 0.093), suggesting that the procedure generally preserved visual function without major deterioration in the short to intermediate term.

2. Comparison With Existing Literature

Our IOP findings align with reports from prior studies such as:

Wagner et al. (BMJ Open Ophthalmology, 2022), which noted a ~10 mmHg reduction post-trabeculectomy with similar preoperative baselines.

Jampel et al. (Arch Ophthalmol, 2002), who emphasized the value of achieving target IOPs without medications as a key surgical goal.

The complete surgical success rate in our cohort—defined as achieving IOP ≤ 21 mmHg without medications—was 6%, while qualified success (same IOP threshold with medications) was 3%. These figures appear low, likely reflecting strict definitions and incomplete data at later timepoints. Additionally, they highlight the importance of considering nuanced outcomes, including visual function and patient-specific treatment goals.

VA preservation is consistent with studies showing that visual recovery is often limited by optic nerve status and pre-existing damage, rather than the surgery itself. While we did not detect statistically significant VA improvement, the absence of VA decline in most patients is reassuring.

3. Predictors of IOP Trajectory

Our linear mixed model revealed that timepoint remained a strong predictor of IOP. Neither age nor surgery type (trabeculectomy alone vs combined with cataract surgery) significantly influenced IOP reduction, although some interaction effects were noted. These findings suggest that while surgical timing is critical, other factors (e.g. bleb morphology, postoperative management) likely mediate longer-term pressure control.

4. Strengths and Limitations

Strengths:

Standardized data cleaning with logMAR VA conversion and structured timepoints.

Use of longitudinal modeling to capture IOP trends across individuals.

Integration of medication status to differentiate between complete and qualified success.

Limitations:

Small sample size, particularly at 2-year follow-up.

Potential information bias from inconsistent documentation of preoperative medications.

Lack of optic nerve or field progression data limits interpretation of functional outcomes.

Retrospective design inherently limits control over confounding and data completeness.

5. Implications for Practice

These findings support trabeculectomy as an effective option for IOP control in resource-limited settings. The procedure offers significant pressure reduction with a substantial proportion of patients achieving medication-free status, which is especially relevant where long-term adherence to topical therapy is challenging.

Future studies should focus on prospective tracking, incorporation of visual field outcomes, and bleb survival analysis, potentially using tools like anterior segment OCT or bleb grading systems.

CONCLUSION

This study demonstrates that trabeculectomy effectively reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma patients, with sustained benefits observed up to two years postoperatively. While the majority of patients maintained stable or improved visual acuity, the gains were not statistically significant, reinforcing the procedure’s value more as a pressure-lowering intervention than a vision-restorative one.

Furthermore, a substantial proportion of patients became medication-free postoperatively, reducing both cost and compliance burdens—an important consideration in low-resource settings. The absence of significant associations with age or surgery type suggests that surgical outcomes are more dependent on postoperative care and individual healing profiles than baseline demographic or procedural variables.

Despite the retrospective nature and sample limitations, this analysis provides real-world insights into the effectiveness of trabeculectomy in typical tertiary practice environments.

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Clinical Practice

Prioritize trabeculectomy as a cost-effective option for IOP control in patients with poor medication adherence or advanced disease.

Incorporate standardized logMAR VA tracking and IOP success criteria into routine EMR documentation.
